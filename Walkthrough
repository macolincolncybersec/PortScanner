Walkthrough of the Port-Scanner Script


```python
import socket
```
- This line imports the `socket` module, which provides low-level networking interfaces for creating and working with sockets.

```python
def scan_ports(target, start_port, end_port):
```
- This line defines a function named `scan_ports` that takes three parameters: `target` (the IP address of the target), `start_port` (the starting port number), and `end_port` (the ending port number). This function will scan the specified range of ports for the target IP address.

```python
for port in range(start_port, end_port + 1):
```
- This line starts a `for` loop that iterates over a range of ports from `start_port` to `end_port + 1`. The loop will go through each port in the specified range.

```python
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
```
- This line creates a socket object using `socket.socket`. The `socket.AF_INET` argument specifies that we're using IPv4 addressing, and `socket.SOCK_STREAM` indicates that we're using TCP/IP sockets.

```python
sock.settimeout(1)
```
- This line sets a timeout value of 1 second for the socket connection. If the connection attempt takes longer than 1 second, the socket will raise a timeout exception.

```python
result = sock.connect_ex((target, port))
```
- This line attempts to connect to the target IP and port using `sock.connect_ex`. It takes a tuple `(target, port)` as the argument, where `target` is the IP address and `port` is the current port being scanned. The `connect_ex` function returns an error code. If the connection is successful, the result will be `0`.

```python
if result == 0:
    print(f"Port {port} is open")
```
- This block checks if the `result` is equal to `0`, indicating a successful connection. If the connection is successful, it prints a message indicating that the port is open.

```python
sock.close()
```
- This line closes the socket connection using `sock.close()`. It is important to close the connection after each iteration to avoid resource leakage.

```python
target_ip = '127.0.0.1'
start_port = 1
end_port = 100
```
- These lines define the target IP address, starting port, and ending port that you want to scan. Modify these values according to your requirements.

```python
scan_ports(target_ip, start_port, end_port)
```
- This line calls the `scan_ports` function with the specified target IP address, starting port, and ending port. It initiates the port scanning process.

That's a breakdown of each line of code in the Python port scanner example. Let me know if you have any further questions!
